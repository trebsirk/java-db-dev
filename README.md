# Demo: Java + Data

This is a demo of database operations in Java, including CRUD ops in SQL with PostgreSQL, and key-value ops in Redis. 

It implements the Service layer and Data Access Object (DAO) Layer. 

The code uses environmental variables for db access, which should be in a `.env` file if running locally. 

Build and run (in linux/mac) with 
```bash
chmod +x build.sh run.sh
./build.sh
./run.sh
```
